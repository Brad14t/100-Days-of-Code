# 100 Days of Code

# Summary:

I'm learning code with the help of Dr. Angela Yu's course on Udemy.

This course is a 100 days, each day a new topic is learned or expanded on, with the use of daily projects.

This repository will be my projects I have completed through my journey, to evantually be able to use Python seemlessly daily.

Below the goal of this project will be pictures of whay the code does. And a short description of what I learned.

# Goal by the End:

**Basic Python Topics:**

Syntax, variables, data types, and control structures (loops, conditionals).
Functions, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and error handling.

**Advanced Python Topics:**

Working with files, modules, and libraries.
Concepts like decorators, list comprehensions, and generators.

**Popular Libraries and Frameworks:**

Libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
Web development with Flask.
Automation with Selenium.
GUI development with Tkinter.

**APIs and Web Scraping:**

How to interact with APIs to retrieve data.
Techniques for web scraping with BeautifulSoup.

**Data Science and Machine Learning:**

Basics of data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Introduction to Machine Learning using scikit-learn.

**Project-Based Learning:**

Over 100 projects, including building games (Snake, Pong), automation tools, web apps, and more.
Real-world applications of Python in tasks like automation, web development, data science, and ML.

**Version Control and Deployment:**

**Day 5**

Password generator

**Takeaways:**

`for` loops and `range`

This generates a randomly ordered password with however many numbers, symbols and letters the user chooses.

**Day 6**

Functions

**Takeaways:**

How to define `functions` (create) and call `functions` (Use the function)

This is a simple function that takes an input and creates a new output from the input and with the use of an `f string`

**Day 7**

Hangman Game

**Takeaways:**

Game Loop Structure: Use of `while` not `game_over`.

User Input and Processing: Getting user input with `input()` and converting to lowercase with `.lower()`.

Tracking Guessed Letters: Using a `list` to track correct guesses.

String Manipulation: Constructing a display string for the word state.

Conditional Statements: `if`...`else` for controlling game logic.

Game Over Conditions: Ending game based on lives or correct guesses.

List and String Operations: Utilizing `list manipulations` and `string operations`.

**Day 8**

Ceasar Cipher

This project takes a message, the user request how many spaces to move the text in the alphabet, escentially encrypting the message. The user can also take messages that have been encrypted and decode them.

**Takeaways:**

`functions` with `inputs`

`positional` vs `Keyword` arguments

importing and using external modules

defining and calling functions

Using lists and basic list operations.
