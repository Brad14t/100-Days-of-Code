# 100 Days of Code

# Summary:

I'm learning code with the help of Dr. Angela Yu's course on Udemy.

This course is a 100 days, each day a new topic is learned or expanded on, with the use of daily projects.

This repository will be my projects I have completed through my journey to evantually be able to use Python seemlessly daily.
